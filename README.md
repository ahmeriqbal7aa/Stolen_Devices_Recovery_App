# Stolen_Devices_Recovery_App
```
A new Flutter-Firebase application with Firebase-Cloud-Firestore and Firebase-Storage.
```

## Description
The problem of theft is increasing day by day. While it is very easy for thieves to sell a stolen item or, we can say, a mobile phone to anyone. We have no way to catch such people. However, if one wants to track a mobile phone, it is also an expensive and difficult task that an ordinary person cannot do on his own. And some people haven’t enough money to get this done by a shopkeeper. This has become a serious problem. That’s why we design this application using **FLUTTER, DART and GOOGLE FIREBASE.**

- HOW TO USE?
  - User will install this app and registered himself in this application. 
  - After registration he can easily stores the data about his products in this application. 
  - While in case of robbery, he can edit his products’ details in this application. 
  - When thief will go to sell the stolen device, purchaser can search by entering identity number of the devices such as IMEI for mobile and VIN for bike and car, if purchaser find the device in the stolen list, he can notify the owner of this mobile through text message or calling. 

This application will save the time of novice user to go police station for complaint about the robbery. He just needs to edit the details in the stolen list and he will get notify when someone will see his product(s).
